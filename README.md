I've created a custome calander that I'll use the resulting displayed date as a string for key up display on the invitation in the next draft.

My current issue is that the current displayed date does not highlight the date in the drop down.

In the script.js file line 78 and 79 should enable the date to be highlighted. For reasons unknown I cannot figure out why it isn't working..

I'm hoping you could help see something I can't. I'll be forever grateful :')

ps. excuse the colour scheme function first beauty second right? :D
